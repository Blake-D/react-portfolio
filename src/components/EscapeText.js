                <b>Escape from D-1471</b> is a first-person shooter/platformer made in <b>Unreal Engine 4</b>. The player must escape from a futuristic floating prison complex through a series of low-gravity freefalls from one platform to another. Built out of love for challenging games, it is designed to be as punishing as possible.
